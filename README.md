# Smart Scout: Your AI Shopping Assistant

Smart Scout is an AI-powered web application that helps users extract and understand product information from any e-commerce product page. It uses web scraping, natural language processing, and a conversational interface to answer user queries about products in a friendly, helpful manner.

---

## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Extracts product details from any provided product URL using a headless browser.
- **Content Cleaning:** Removes unnecessary sections (headers, footers, reviews, etc.) and cleans the content for better AI processing.
- **AI-Powered Q&A:** Uses a local LLM (Ollama with Llama 3.1) to answer user questions about the product.
- **Conversational UI:** Chat interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **Caching:** Efficient response caching for faster repeated queries.
